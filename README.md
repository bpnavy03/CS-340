#How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in #this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I wrote my programs using in-line comments and easy-to-read modulization in order to preserve readability, adaptability, and maintainability. Keeping the dashboard separate from the CRUD commands is extremely useful and can be beneficial to many programmers and companies. This CRUD Python module could be used for and modified to be utilized with any MongoDB demands.

#How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or #strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, I try to understand the problem first so that I can develop potential solutions. I then try to decide which solution would be the best based on if it would be maintainable, adaptable, and readable. Regarding the Grazioso Salvare requirements, creating a list of technical specifications and requirements is key to successfully developing an end product that satisfies the customer and end-user. I would use similiar skills and techniques if I needed to perform this kind of work in the future.

#What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists solve computer problems for end-users. These problems included developing solutions to expedite a process, solve already existing software problems, or to develop new and improved ways to make life better and easier. This matters because computer scientists are a part of nearly every industry in the world, and our skills and tools help make this world a better place. The skills I demonstrated in this project would be extremely to any company that utilizes databases.
